# Linux Kernel Week 2 Notes

### - Operating system structures

> * 1. Hardware -> Drivers-> Linux Kernel-> System Call->Apps
>
>      * Monolithic kernel: no access protection between kernel subsystem and function
>
>      * Micro kernel: protected by scheduler for different apps.
>
>      * Virtual address: process addr and kernel addr
>
>      * Preemptive multitask/Kernel
>
>      * Kernel stack 12KB to avoid bound. 
>
>      * Asymmetric/symmetric multiprocessing
>
> *  2. Linux source code layout (process/Memory management  Device drivers/Arch)
